# Smart Surveillance Camera

A new surveillance approach capable of operating with minimal network bandwidth requirements (Verkada Approach).
By compromising on the video quality or additional memory requirements for the videocamera this approach make possible to:

- reduce cloud costs by sending just the data requested by the surveillance user

- support surveillance for low network bandwidth

- enabling to scale real time video survaillance up to a thousand of videocameras in the same network

## Project:

This repository implements a demo of the previous approach and it is composed by three parts:

- Server folder: for the server side application

- SmartCam folder: for the camera software

- App folder: it contains file to build a flutter mobile application

Note: project done in collaboration with Giuseppe Bisicchia. Implemented for the Mobile & Cyberphysical System course 2021.
